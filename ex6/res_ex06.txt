6a:

The tasks are executed in order of priority. So we see task 2 completing first,
then task 1 and then task 0. This is beacause they are all ready to execute at 
once when the semaphore is broadcasted, the sceduler notices task 2
has the highest priority so it executes that first, etc.

6b: task 1 is nog executed before task 2, because it was created earlier.
