starting tasks
Task name: t1 arg: 1 
Task name: t2 arg: 2 
Task name: t3 arg: 3 
Task name: t4 arg: 4 
Task name: t5 arg: 5 

The order hasn't changed even though the priorities have changed. This is
because the tasks are strted immideatly (real time) and so they run before
the next task can be started (singel core CPU)
